            ## Auto-generated Image Variants
            
            This PR was automatically created because changes were detected in the original profile image or the generation script.
            
            ### Generated variants:
            - Avatar (header): 40px, 80px @2x
            - Hero (main): 196px, 392px @2x  
            - Spares: 256px, 320px (+ @2x variants)
            
            ### Formats:
            - ✅ AVIF (best compression)
            - ✅ WebP (modern fallback)
            - ✅ JPEG (universal fallback)
            
            All variants include 1x and 2x (retina) versions for crisp display on high-DPI screens.
