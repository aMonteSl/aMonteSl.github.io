    "bio1": "I am a Telecommunications Engineer graduated from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in 2026, with a strong focus on practical building and continuous learning. I enjoy understanding how systems work internally and transforming that knowledge into clear, well-designed, and useful solutions.\n\nI particularly value projects where I can be involved end-to-end: from initial idea and architectural decisions to implementation, documentation, and iterative improvement. For me, programming is not just about writing code—it is about structuring complex problems and turning them into coherent, maintainable systems.",
    "bio2": "I consider myself curious, disciplined, and committed. I value teamwork, clear communication, and ownership of what I build. I am motivated by technical challenges and by exploring different professional domains to keep growing both technically and personally.\n\nOutside of purely technical work, I enjoy traveling, discovering new cultures and perspectives, and maintaining a healthy balance between professional growth and personal life. I believe this balance helps me bring a broader perspective to the projects I work on.",
